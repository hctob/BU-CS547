High Performance Computing with Professor Kenneth Chiu


## p1_redo: 
C++ Definite Integral Calculator, rewritten to use C++ thread library + lambda functions instead of pthread API.

## p2:
C++ KD-Tree. Constructs and searches for k nearest neighbors from millions of points in only a few seconds.

## p3:
SIMD instruction sets for data parallelism and OpenMP high-level threading API

## p4(need to clone still):
Definite Integral Calculator run on Graphics cards by using CUDA
